This testdef is used to test a stealth feature in mpaso introduced by
PR #7361. It simplies changes one mpaso namelist variable,
    config_use_precip_scaling
from its default value of .false. to .true.. It also sets associated
variables,
    config_precip_scaling_mode
    config_precip_scaling_constant_factor
for testing. This particular testdef also limmits the required JRA
forcing data to a single year to reduce the number of files needed for
testing.
