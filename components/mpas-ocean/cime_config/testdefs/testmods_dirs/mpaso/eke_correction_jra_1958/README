This testdef is used to test a stealth feature in mpaso introduced by
PR #7723. It simplies changes one mpaso namelist variable,
    config_eke_correction_enable
from its default value of .false. to .true..  This particular testdef
also limmits the required JRA forcing data to a single year to reduce
the number of files needed for testing.
